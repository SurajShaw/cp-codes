/**
 * The below solution uses Matrix Exponentiation.
 * 
 * There's a ball at top of tetrahedron and can go to any other vertex connected to it. Moving from one vertex to another cost a
 * distance of 1. Value of path length is given, say L. We've to tell in how many ways the ant can return to the vertex 
 * from where it started after traversing length L. Technically we've to find out the number of different cyclic paths with the 
 * length of L from starting vertex to itself.
 * 
 * As it's a tetrahedron so this is a regular graph of degree 3. Just build the adjacency matrix and raise it to the power L.
 * 
 * Proof - https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2434064/proof-raising-adjacency-matrix-to-n-th-power-gives-n-length-walks-between
